# LED BLINK EXAMPLE

This code demonstrates a simple LED Blink example using ESP-IDF(Espressif IoT Development Framework) for ESP32 microcontrollers.
It toggles a LED for every 1 seconds.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the ESP-IDF development framework and the necessary tools for building and flashing firmware to ESP32 microcontrollers. Make sure you have set up the development environment according to the ESP-IDF documentation.

## Hardware Setup

Connect a LED and 220 ohm resistor to GPIO 26
For this code ESP32_DevKit_V4 is used
